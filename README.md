# Wi-Fi Direct Nearby Devices List Android App

## Overview
This Android application allows users to discover and display a list of nearby devices using Wi-Fi Direct. Users can initiate a scan for nearby devices, and the app will populate a list with the discovered devices. For the names of devices to appear in the list, both devices need to be running the app and have Wi-Fi Direct enabled.

## Features

- Wi-Fi Direct support on the device.
- At least two devices running the app with Wi-Fi Direct enabled to display each other's names in the list.
